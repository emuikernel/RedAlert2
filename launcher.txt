Commander:

Thanks for your continued participation in the global war effort against the 
madman Yuri.  Our boys at the Lab have come up with some modifications for 
your arsenal that should improve your battle experiences.  Review the following 
bulletin from Command Headquarters with great care.  Commit it to memory. 
Your understanding of these could be crucial to your victory or defeat on the 
battlefield!


Good Luck.

--President Michael Dugan






CHANGES & FEATURE UPDATES:


General:
*	To maximize game performance for all game modes, it's best to set the 
game's resolution to 640 x 480 pixels.  The higher the resolution setting, 
the slower the game's performance, especially on lower end PCs.
 
*	Another way to maximize WOL game performance is to never adjust the 
Internet Connection Slider (in WOL Options Screen).  The game 
determines the optimal setting before starting the battle.  This is often 
confused by users in believing moving this slider will increase the game's 
speed, which it does not.

*	PCs with more than one CD Rom device caused the game to launch 
slowly.  This has been fixed.
 


Units & Structures:
*	Sometimes the Con Yard would disappear if it was captured by Yuri 
Prime, and then Yuri Prime was killed while the Con Yard was being 
packed up.  This has been fixed by not allowing the player to deploy/un-
deploy the Con Yard in this situation.
 
*	Sometimes an exiting vehicle would be stuck on the edge of the War 
Factory causing the War Factory to become unusable if the vehicle were 
chrono'd just as it was about to come out of the structure.  This will no 
longer happen.

*	Oil Derricks did not animate on some maps.  This has now been fixed.
 
*	Sometimes an exiting Robot Tank may be stuck on the edge of the War 
Factory and causing the War Factory to become unusable, if the Robot 
Control Center was destroyed just as the tank was about to come out of 
the structure.  This will no longer happen.

*	If a vehicle being repaired by a Repair Depot was chrono'd to a new 
location, that vehicle would continue to be repaired even though it was no 
longer on the Repair Depot.  This has been fixed.

*	The player could sell a vehicle that was being repaired on an Allied Repair 
Depot, unlike the Soviet Repair Depot.  Now, the player can't use either 
type of Repair Depots to sell vehicles.

*	Infantry were allowed to interact (garrison, un-garrison, engineer, and C4) 
with a building that was being chrono'd by a Chrono Legionnaire.  Doing 
so would disrupt the chrono effect.  These will no longer be allowed.

*	If the enemy units garrison/un-garrison a building, Boris' laser designator 
could be interrupted and the MiGs called off.  This will no longer happen.

*	Using the Genetic Mutator on any infantry on a bridge killed the infantry 
rather than being transformed to Brutes.  Now, the infantry will be turned 
into Brutes.

*	If the player placed an infantry unit with a Crazy Ivan bomb on it into a 
Battle Fortress, waited for the timer to tick down, then deployed the 
infantry, the bomb would be gone.  Now, the bomb will explode right after 
the infantry exits the Battle Fortress.

*	If any unit that can attack from within a Battle Fortress was placed in a 
Battle Fortress, then into an Amphibious Transport, then moved 
elsewhere, the player would still retain the ability to attack from the 
location where the Battle Fortress was loaded, even though the unit is no 
longer there.  This has been fixed.

*	The Air Force Command HQ can no longer have rally points.

*	Now you can set the Naval Yard's rally point while it's being 
placed/constructed.

*	Using a Magnetron to levitate, and then drop, a vehicle over a high bridge, 
would cause the vehicle to fall through the bridge and land on the water 
below.  Now, the vehicle will no longer fall through the bridge.

*	Sometimes, the Magnetron would become confused and continuously pick 
up and drop an enemy vehicle.  This has been fixed.

*	A Squids could be pulled onto land if it was chrono'd or magnetron'd while 
attacking a vehicle.  Now, a chrono'd squid will be killed; a magnetron'd 
Squid will let go.

*	If a Slave Miner were dropped into water, the freed Slaves would turn 
neutral instead of joining the player that freed them.  Now, the slaves will 
join the player that freed them.

*	Sometimes, when a Battle Fortress full of infantry was deployed, the 
infantry would become uncontrollable as they walked back where they 
came from or attack the enemy's base.  This has been fixed.

*	When a vehicle carrying additional units was sent into a Grinder, the 
player would receive money only for that vehicle.  Now, the player will 
receive money for all units it's carrying, too, including Terror Drones.

*	Sometimes a stray unit would get stuck in a Grinder, causing the Grinder 
to become unusable.  This has been fixed.

*	When a Yuri Clone was loaded into a Battle Fortress, then mind controlled 
an enemy unit, and that Battle Fortress was sent into a Grinder, the player 
could still control that mind-controlled unit even though the Yuri Clone had 
already been destroyed.  Now, the mind-controlled unit will be returned to 
its previous owner.

*	In a multiplayer game, if the host loaded a Yuri clone, Yuri Prime, or Psi 
Commando into a Battle Fortress, then mind controlled enemy units, then 
ordered this Battle Fortress into a Grinder and exited the game, the 
guest's game would receive an internal error.  This has been fixed.

*	If a hero unit (Tanya, Boris, Yuri Prime) was placed into a transport, and 
that transport was destroyed on water, the player would not be allowed to 
make another one of these units.  This has been fixed.

*	The planes from the Allied Aircraft Carrier could be made to attack out of 
range targets if you switch targets while it's firing its missiles.  Now, this 
will no longer be allowed. 
 
*	Yuri Clone's psychic blast used to harm nearby Yuri Prime units.  Now, 
Yuri Prime is immune to Yuri Clone's psychic blasts.

*	When a GI or Guardian GI was affected by the Chaos Drone's gas, the 
owner of that unit could still continue to deploy and un-deploy it.  This will 
no longer be allowed.

*	The AI-controlled Yuri Prime would never sell off the captured buildings.  
Now, the AI-controlled Yuri Prime will sell off any building it captures.

*	The production of the Navy Seal unit will now be accompanied with an 
audio announcement as it comes out of the Barracks.

*	The LAX building can now be garrisoned in multiplayer games.

*	Deployed Guardian GIs had problems harming the Paratroopers.  Now, 
the Paratroopers will take damage.

*	An elite Magnetron's firing range was a bit shorter than a standard 
Magnetron.  It now has the same range.

*	The Gattling Cannon's ground-target attack range has been slightly 
increased.

*	Boris' attack cursor and attack action on the occupied Tank Bunker was 
reversed.  Now, whenever Boris attacks an occupied Tank Bunker, the 
MiGs will be called.

*	Tanya used to be allowed to attack the vehicle inside the Tank Bunker.  
This will no longer be allowed.

*	The Soviet's Spy Plane and MiGs have been made more durable. 

*	An IFV loaded with infantry could be made to look like a standard IFV by 
building a wall around it, then deploying it.  This will no longer be allowed.

*	The Rhino Tank's build speed has been slightly decreased.

*	The Siege Chopper's cost has been slightly decreased.

*	The Slave Miner's cost has been slightly increased.

*	If ordered from the Structure Tab, the Slave Miner now builds slightly 
slower.  However, if ordered from the Units Tab, the Slave Miner now 
builds slightly faster.

*	The Chaos Drone now costs slightly more, builds and shoots slightly 
slower.



Multiplay:

*	Trainers that remove the game's shroud will no longer work.  If any such 
hack is detected, the game will be forced out of sync and the cheater will 
be logged for corrective action.
 
*	Sometimes, if the host had quit out of the game channel right after it was 
created, the client would become stuck in the lobby and unable to respond 
at all.  Now, the client will time out and properly return to the lobby.

*	All screens that might experience slow Internet connection now have an 
active indicator to inform the user that the system has not locked up during 
lengthy waiting periods.
 
*	The Clan Abbreviation column in the WOL lobby has been expanded to 
accommodate longer names/text.


Other:

*	Using large font can result in some shell screen issues.  For example, text 
position on the buttons could be off, start positions and team fields could 
be off in the drop-down selection boxes, etc.  To correct this, set your 
system font to the standard/small font.  [Desktop ? Properties ? 
Appearance ? Scheme ? Windows Standard].

*	If you are using Windows 2000, or Windows XP, or systems with multi-
processors, and you experience problems with the movie's audio, then set 
the system's audio Hardware Acceleration down to the Basic setting 
(under Audio Properties).

Commander:

Welcome back!  Thank you for extending your tour of duty.  Your outstanding 
service is greatly appreciated by the High Command and people all over the 
World.  Due to the chaotic disruptions caused by Yuri's psychic technologies, the 
following information must be kept classified until you are ready for action.  
Review the following bulletin from Command Headquarters with great care.  
Commit it to memory, so you can be decisive and victorious out on the battlefield!

Good Luck.

--President Michael Dugan




GENERAL CHANGES & FEATURE UPDATES


General:
*	In the Game Option screen, the Game Resolution setting only sets the in-
game (battlefield) resolution.  The game shell screen resolution is locked 
at 800 by 600 pixels.
 
*	With the Short Game selected, Yuri's Slave Miner is excluded from the 
winning condition.

*	Now all players can see the infantry pips of any fortifiable civilian building, 
regardless of which player garrisons it.

*	When a unit is mind controlled, all players will see the initial mind-control 
line from the controller to its victim.

*	The T (unit-type select) and P (all-unit select) hot-keys will automatically 
exclude units inside of a Tank Bunker.

*	In Red Alert 2, sometimes a game would not end if the last remaining unit 
were in a mind-controlled vehicle.  Now, if this should happen, the unit 
inside will be automatically killed, and the ex-owner of the captured unit 
will be declared the loser.

*	Tab-flash-for-readiness has been updated.  The following features will 
only flash the tab for a bit to inform the player when fully charged: Spy 
Plane, Force Shield, Psychic Reveal.

*	If playing behind a firewall, the preview maps do not get transmitted to 
other players.


Units & Structures:
*	Magnetron can only levitate vehicles, not infantry.

*	The Brute is not allowed inside of an IFV.  However, the Brute is allowed 
inside other transports, but only as a passenger.

*	The Hero units (Tanya, Boris, and Yuri Prime) are not allowed to use their 
special attack from within the Battle Fortress.

*	Kirov spinning every time it acquires an order/target is now fixed.

*	Setting waypoints for planes from within the radar map has been disabled.

*	Floating Disc will auto target and shoot any base defenses that are 
powered (i.e. Prism Tower and Tesla Coil).  However, the Floating Disc 
will not auto target and shoot any base defenses that are not powered 
(i.e. Pillbox and Sentry Gun).

*	Psychic Dominator permanently "captures" its victims rather than just 
mind controls them for a short duration.  Once a unit has been psychic 
dominated (purple halo on the unit), it can never be mind controlled again.

*	Yuri Prime and Yuri Clone's psychic blast do not harm friendly units.

*	Cloning Vats allow the player to make a second Hero unit (Tanya, Boris, 
and Yuri Prime).


Multiplay:

*	In the Westwood Online Quick Match and Quick Co-op games, the Super 
Weapons setting is always on, and the Crates setting is always to off.

*	In Team Alliance game mode, you must set your teams at the start.  Once 
the battle has started, you are not allowed to switch alliance.

*	In Land Rush game mode, the Yuri player begins with a few Attack Dogs 
among his starting units.

*	In Skirmish: Battle mode, all AI players start out on the same team fighting 
against the human player.



Other:

*	Known problems with the Cirrus Logic 5464 video card:  Systems with this
device may experience the following problems: low frame rate, slow movie playback,
and audio distortion.

*	Known problems with USB sound devices:  There seems to be some sort of
conflict with USB sound devices.  If using these devices, the game may load with
no audio.  Examples of such devices: the Altec Lansing ADA70 USB Speakers, Microsoft 
Digital Sound System 80 USB.

*	Known problems with Ensoniq SoundScape and OPTI 82C 931:  Systems with this
device may experience the following problems: some random audio stuttering and
popping in game and movies.


*	Information from the previous Readme files still applies.  Please review 
the archive section below for additional information.

Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 TM

LATE BREAKING NEWS FROM THE FRONT

Copyright 2000 Electronic Arts Inc. All rights reserved.
Westwood Studios TM is an Electronic Arts TM brand.

Patch 1.006

May 25th, 2001

For latest news and updates visit WWW.WESTWOOD.COM


--------------------------------------------TOP SECRET--------------------------------------------

Commander:

Thanks for your continued participation in the war effort. We have been able to 
make some modifications to your tactical display that should improve your 
experiences on the battlefield.

Good Luck.

--President Michael Dugan

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


GENERAL CHANGES 


Fixes:
*	Chrono IFV no longer loses its target when selecting a target further than 
his firing range. Now it moves within attack range and fires without losing 
focus at any moment.

*	Modified official maps are not transferred over Internet games. 

*	If a player disconnects 3 times in one game for durations more than 25 
seconds each, the game will finish and be awarded to the non-
disconnector at the 3rd time.  

*	If walls or other buildings block the Soviet Barracks exit, no unit is built 
even if the user has a Cloning Vat. The cost is refunded to the player. 

*	No other infantry units other than those with explosives can blow up 
buildings when joining to a Tanya command waypoint.


WESTWOOD ONLINE CHANGES OR FEATURE ADDITIONS

New Features
*	NAT (Network Address Translation) and Firewall support (Notice: See 
Firewall & NAT Support later on this document)

Fixes
*	In 4 player Internet games,  Red Alert 2 TM now behaves correctly and 
continues the match with the remaining players when the host loses 
connection.

*	The game now behaves correctly by continuing 4 player Internet games 
when the host gets disconnected from his ISP but is able to reconnect in 
time.

*	In-game chat,  whenever the user types a message longer than a screen 
width the text is transmitted and displayed properly.



FIREWALL AND NAT SUPPORT

Red Alert 2 TM now automatically supports firewalls and network address 
translating (NAT) while playing on Westwood Online.

Note: in this document the term "firewall" is used to refer to both firewall and 
"network address translation" products.

The following hardware/software was used in testing:

Hardware:
Linksys BEFSR11 / BEFSR14
Netgear RT311 / RT314
DLink DI-701 / DI-702
SonicWall Tele / Soho2

Software:
Windows 98 ICS (Internet Connection Sharing)
Sygate Home Networking 4.0
NAT32 Plus 1.4 (build 1-16-01)

Even if your firewall was not listed, it is likely that it will work with this patch.  
Many firewalls have the same behavior.  




Automatic Firewall/NAT support

Red Alert 2 TM now automatically supports the above firewalls out of the box, with 
no need to configure esoteric settings on the firewalls, such as port forwarding, 
triggers, static mapping or any of the other complicated settings that might 
otherwise be needed.

Support is complete and transparent, including the following features:

1.	Supports hosting or joining any game when behind a firewall.

2.	Supports multiple players behind the same firewall; if you have more than 
one system on a home LAN sharing a cable modem, DSL or other 
connection you can now play against each other or against other players 
on the  Internet.

Now when a game is launched on Westwood Online, you will see a "Connecting 
To Other Players" dialogue box.  Here you will be able to see your connectivity to 
the other players in the game.  If any player cannot establish a connection with 
another, the game will not launch.  A message will appear explaining who is 
having difficulty connecting.

It is necessary on some firewalls to wait for packets to be received from other 
players before trying to connect.  If your firewall has this behavior, you will need 
to enable "Send Delay" in the network options.  From the main menu, select 
"Options" then "Network".  Using this setting may cause connection problems 
with other players if used unnecessarily.  Please refer to your firewall 
documentation to see how your firewall operates. (note: Netgear firewalls model 
numbers RT311 & RT314 were found to require this setting during our testing)

Note to firewall manufacturers: if your firewall products are not among the tested 
firewalls we'd love to hear from you! Contact  gameresearch@westwood.com 
in Westwood Studios   


Manual Firewall/NAT support

In addition to the automatic firewall support features listed above, we have 
included an advanced setting for advanced users that can be used if all else fails. 
From the main menu, select "Options" then "Network". Under the "Internet 
Firewall Settings" section you'll see a "port number" option, which can be used to 
instruct  Red Alert 2 TM to always use the port specified here. You should use a 
port number between 1024 and 65535. Every computer that you want to play the 
game on should be given a different port number if they are all behind the same 
firewall.
To return to the automatic mode, remove the port number from the "port number" 
edit box.

If you specify a port for Red Alert 2 TM to use then you will have to manually 
configure your firewall with static IP and port forwarding to route packets to the 
correct computer. Each firewalls configuration method is different so consult your 
firewalls documentation for instructions on how to do this. You will probably have 
to assign a static IP to each computer connecting to the firewall otherwise the 
static forwarding rules may not work after restarting a computer or firewall.


Dual Network Cards in Windows 98

A Windows 98 client can only have one gateway at a time. This means that if you 
are running  Red Alert 2 TM in a Windows 98 machine that has 2 or more   network 
cards you will need to get sure that the traffic is going through the right one. The 
best way to do this is disabling all network cards except the one who gives you 
the connectivity to the Internet/LAN. Otherwise you can have connectivity 
problems when running Red Alert 2 TM. 


FINALALERT 2 TM SUPORT AND TIPS

FinalAlert 2 TM is a mission editor for Red Alert 2 TM.  It can be downloaded from 
www.westwood.com free of charge.  Westwood Studios and the original 
FinalAlert developer have been hard at work adding and improving functionality.  
Here are some of the items we've been working on.

*	Framework mode is now included.

*	Allows raising and lowering of tile placement heights.

*	Randomizes land tiles within the editor to improve open area aesthetics in 
the map.  

*	Fixes bugs for raising/lowering terrain.  FinalAlert 2 TM used to create map 
holes that are very difficult to detect and fix.  Framework mode helps with 
this a great deal also.

*	Includes an indication of current terrain height.
	
*	Includes an indication of current ore/gem count on map.
	
*	Includes Uninstall.
	
*	Increased time allowed on Westwood Online to transfer maps between 
players.  Now up to 3 minutes.  
	
*	Only allows FinalAlert 2 TM map sharing in non-tourney games.
	
*	Allows sharing of map names.

*	Includes random tree placement tool.

*	Optimizes the FinalAlert 2 TM map load times, especially when there are 
lots of custom maps in the game folder.

*	Red Alert 2 TM will not add starting spots to a FinalAlert 2 TM map if it has 2 
or more predefined starting spots.

*	Red Alert 2 TM now can now use maps created with FinalAlert 2 TM in all 
game modes.

*	Allows map names to appear when using FinalAlert 2 TM (User created) 
maps.

Please note:  When a custom made map is transferred to a guest player, it will 
not become available in the map listing until Red Alert 2 TM is restarted.  
Therefore, if more than one game is going to be set on a custom map, it is 
recommended that the guest(s) quit the game after the first match (once the map 
has been transferred).  Otherwise the map will be transferred every time a new 
game is started.

1.	WINDOWS 95/98/NT/Millenium

1.1. Microsoft DirectX:

Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 is a Microsoft DirectX application. 
Version 7.0 of Microsoft DirectX is included on the CD and you have the 
option to install it when Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 is installed.

Under some early versions of Windows 95, DirectX 7.0 cannot be installed 
directly from the Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 installer. If this occurs, 
please run DXSetup.exe located on the CD in the DXSetup folder.
 
All Microsoft DirectX drivers are located in the DXSetup folder off of the 
root of the CD. To reinstall the Microsoft DirectX drivers go into the 
DXSetup folder and run DXSetup.exe. You can explore the CD by 
choosing the "Explore the CD" option in the AutoPlay title screen. If you 
have difficulty running Windows 95/98 after these new Microsoft DirectX 
drivers have been installed, please contact your local Microsoft subsidiary, 
or write:

	Microsoft Customer Sales and Service,
		One Microsoft Way,
	Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA

		USA telephone: 1-800-426-9400
	International telephone: ++1-206-882-8080

1.2. Microsoft Office Toolbar:

If you make use of this feature of Microsoft Office and it appears over the 
game screen when playing Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 you will 
have to disable the Office Toolbar before playing.

1.3. Windows NT 4.0:

Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 requires Service Pack 3 or later 
versions to be installed in order to work with Windows NT 4.0. Please 
contact your computer manufacturer if you need to get Service Pack 3.

1.4. Windows ME:

Windows ME DirectX appears to have hardware conflicts with some 2mb 
video cards. The cards may work well with Windows ME itself, and even 
other games, but with Red Alert 2 you may experience black screen 
lockups when loading the game. The problem may be corrected by 
updating the video card driver to Windows ME compatible drivers, 
updating your version of DirectX, or upgrading to a 4mb card or higher.


2.	TROUBLE SHOOTING

2.1. Known Video Card Issues:

Video monitor settings may need to be adjusted after installing the 
Microsoft DirectX video drivers. If you screen distorts, or is shifted 
horizontally or vertically, you can return it to normal by adjusting the 
controls on your monitor. 

Most video display problems can be corrected by installing the latest 
drivers for your particular card. Please consult your video card 
documentation for details on how to get the latest drivers for your card. 

If you are using the Microsoft Theme Pack and have selected a custom 
cursor, video corruption can occur. For best results, please use default 
cursors while playing Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2.

Users with integrated Intel 3D graphic cards (2MB AGP) may experience 
refresh problems at high resolutions (above 640x480). In order to fix this 
problem, modify the [VIDEO] section of the RA2.INI file located in the RA2 
root directory to include: 

VideoBackBuffer=no

(This also includes any users with low end video cards, experiencing any 
trails or refresh problems at any resolution)

2.2. Known Sound Card Issues:

Old SoundBlaster AWE 64 and AWE 32 sound card drivers can cause 
skipping and repeating sound that may cause your computer to run 
Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 much slower than normal. If you have 
one of these sound cards and are experiencing these symptoms, please 
contact your card manufacturer for latest drivers.

Audio may stutter on certain systems running Windows NT. To correct this 
problem you must install the latest audio driver for your sound card.

Most sound card problems can be corrected by installing the latest drivers 
for your particular card. Please consult your sound card documentation for 
details on how to get the latest drivers.

If you are using USB speakers, do not turn off the speakers during 
gameplay. Doing so may cause your system to become unstable and 
even crash.

2.3. Known DirectX Issues:

If another application is using the sound card while trying to install or run 
the game, a "DXSound Error" will appear. If this error occurs, please close 
all applications and run the install or game again.

2.4. Gateway Computer Users:

If you are using a Gateway computer with "Gateway GoBack" software by 
WildFile running in the background, you may experience lockups in Red 
Alert 2. GoBack is loaded in the Windows system tray (by the clock) and 
represented by two yellow arrows. To close out GoBack, right click on the 
double yellow arrows in the system tray, and select close. It is 
recommended that you close all programs running in the background 
before starting Red Alert 2.

2.5. Virtual Memory Settings:

Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 may need to use more RAM than is 
present on your system. Windows 95/98 automatically takes care of this 
by using what is known as "Virtual Memory" - which uses space on your 
hard disk to simulate the memory it needs and swaps data back and forth 
from your hard disk as required. Windows 95/98 allows you to manually 
set the amount of hard drive space it uses for Virtual Memory: WE 
HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT DO THIS! To let Windows 
95/98 manage the Virtual Memory, go to the Windows 95/98 start menu, 
select 'settings\control panel', then double-click 'system', click 
'performance\file\system\virtual memory' and then select 'Let Windows 
manage my virtual memory settings (recommended).'

2.6. Known RealPlayer Issues:

RealPlayer seems to have a conflict with the movie player used in Red 
Alert 2. With RealPlayer's "Start Center" feature enabled (which seems to 
keep RealPlayer resident in some form) we have found stability issues 
when exiting Red Alert 2 as it goes to the desktop.

2.7. AutoPlay:

If your CD does not AutoPlay when inserted in the drive, you may have 
this feature disabled. To Enable AutoPlay, right click on 'My Computer' 
and select 'Properties' then 'Device Manager'. Select your CD-ROM drive 
and click 'Properties'. Select 'Settings' and check the 'Auto insert 
notification' box.

2.8. 16 bit CD-ROM drivers:

Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 may fail to start if there is a 16 bit CD-
ROM driver loaded from the AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS. If you 
have references to MSCDEX or equivalent drivers then try removing them 
from your autoexec.bat and config.sys files. Windows 95/98 does not 
generally need these drivers to work and in most cases will actually 
perform better without them.

2.9. CD-Changers and Multi-Drivers:

Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 does not support multiple CD-ROM 
drives or CD-changers and assumes that you only have one CD-ROM 
drive. If you have more than one CD-ROM drive, you should insert the 
Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 CD in the first CD drive letter. For 
example, if you have CD drives E:, F: and G:, your Command & Conquer: 
Red Alert 2 CD should be inserted into the E: drive.

2.10. Choppy movie performance:

If you find that the movie performance is choppy or jerky, try reducing the 
Windows 95/98 CD caching by going to the Start/Settings/Control Panel 
and double-clicking the System applet. In the System Properties dialog, 
click the Performance tab and then click the File System button. From the 
File System Properties dialog, click the CD-ROM tab and note the 
Supplemental Cache Size setting (so that you can reset the cache size if 
need be). Now set the Supplemental Cache Size to Small. This should 
have a marked effect on movie performance.

You can also try adjusting your detail settings in the Options Menu. Low 
Detail will remove effects like water wakes behind ships, smoke and effect 
lines. Red Alert 2 will also dynamically remove animations in certain 
situations on low spec machines to ensure a high quality game 
performance.

2.11. Power Saving Modes:

It is possible that your computer loses connection to your ISP due to long 
periods of inactivity. Sometimes this is caused by the sleep mode in your 
"Power Saving" options. This can cause problems during game play or 
when connected to Westwood Online. To avoid any problems please 
disable your screen saver or power-saving modes when running the 
game.
	
2.12. Periodic Slowdowns:

If periodic slowdowns occur while playing Command & Conquer: Red Alert 
2 and the CD is not being accessed please insure that there are no other 
applications running during your game session. This includes anti-virus 
software.

2.13. Game Updates and Patches:
		
Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 contains an auto-updating feature. 
Updated versions of the game will be announced to you when playing 
Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 on Westwood Online. When an 
updated version of the game is available you will be able to receive it and 
automatically have it installed, if you wish. If you do not intend to play 
Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 on Westwood Online then please 
check www.westwood.com for update information.

2.14. Connection Speed Slider:

Red Alert 2 has a game-latency tolerance setting in the Game Options 
screen that allows players to increase the tolerance of network latency on 
laggy connections for Internet gaming. To adjust, move the slider to the 
appropriate setting. For example, if you were connecting over a modem, 
the best setting for you would be "Normal" or "Poor". If you are connecting 
over a broadband connection (Cable Modem or DSL), move the slider to 
"Fast". This attempts to match your system with your connection for peak 
performance. Moving the slider from Poor or Normal to Fast can have an 
adverse effect on game performance.

2.15. Dual Network Cards and IPX Issues: 

If you have two network cards in your computer and both have the IPX 
protocol bound to them, you can use the "Network Options" to choose the 
card which you'd like to use. Note: on some Windows 95 and 98 systems 
and in some configurations, Red Alert 2 can't see your second network 
card. A workaround to this problem is to disable your primary card in 
Windows device manager and reboot. Red Alert 2 should successfully see 
and utilize your second network card. Please refer to your Windows 
documentation for more information on how to disable your primary 
network card.

2.16.  Firewall Issues:

If you are playing Red Alert 2 behind a firewall and wish to host a game, 
you must open the following ports:  Port 1234, 1235, 1236, 1237.  These 
ports use the UDP protocol.  If you do not know how to configure your 
firewall consult your firewall documentation or contact your system 
administrator or Internet Provider.

2.17.  Network Address Translation (NAT) Games:

If your network is using Network Address Translation, two or more users 
behind the NAT'd firewall will be unable to play in the same game.  They 
will, however, be able to play in different games.
